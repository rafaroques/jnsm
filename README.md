# A Fault Tolerance-aware Schedule Framework for NFV in Data Centers
Supplementary materials: datasets

In this paper, an integrated, intelligent framework for scheduling VNFs is proposed. In particular, the proposed schedule solution is based on Long-term Memory Techniques (LSTM), which allow generating forecast at multi-steps ahead of schedule based on data center affinity rules, while the diagnostic tool is based on a holistic analysis of the systemâ€™s performability, performance, and availability..
